## Description

Designed and implemented a modular phonebook application using a hash table for efficient data storage and retrieval. The 
Phonebook Management System supports insertion, deletion, updating of previous entries, searching, and file preservation 
while handling collisions and lazy deletion. The project was structured across multiple source files to emphasize clean 
architecture, encapsulation, and maintainability. Performance considerations, such as load factor tracking and rehashing, 
were incorporated to ensure scalability as the dataset grows.
